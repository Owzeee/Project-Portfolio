Project Features:

- Input File Reading: Reads book records from CSV files listed in Part1_input_file_names.txt.

- Error Handling: Handles syntax errors (like too many/few fields, unknown genres) and semantic errors (invalid ISBNs, prices, years).

- Validation: Enforces rules for valid prices, years, and ISBNs.

- Output File Categorization: Writes syntactically correct records to genre-based CSV files.

- Custom Exceptions: Implements specific exceptions for different syntax and semantic errors.

- Serialization (Part 2): Converts semantically valid book records into serialized binary files.

- Interactive Navigation (Part 3): Deserializes binary files and allows users to navigate through book records with a menu-driven interface.

- Efficient File Management: Manages file operations and record processing efficiently.
